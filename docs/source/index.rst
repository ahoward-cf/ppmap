Welcome to PPMAP's documentation!
=================================

PPMAP is a Bayesian Point Process fitting routine for estimating the optical depth and dust properties of astrophysical objects from far-infrared and sub-millimetre observations.

PPMAP was developed by [Ken Marsh](https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/science/staff/kenneth-marsh). 

PPMAP was first described in [Marsh, et al. 2015, **MNRAS 454**](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stv2248).

PPMAP is currently maintained by [Alexander Howard](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/913995-howard-alexander)

PPMAP is undergoing development. If you would like to run PPMAP, please contact Alexander Howard directly at alexander.howard@astro.cf.ac.uk for help in installing and running PPMAP.
